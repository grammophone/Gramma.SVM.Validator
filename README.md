# Gramma.SVM.Validator
This is an example WPF application using the [Gramma.SVM](https://github.com/grammophone/Gramma.SVM) library to train and validate binary classifiers over sparse vector inputs. For training and validation, it consumes two-class data files in [LIBSVM](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm) format.
